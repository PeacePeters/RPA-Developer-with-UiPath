# RPA-Sorting-Annual-Reports-using-UiPath

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is automating computer tasks by executing software robots on a machine or computer. These robots are configured to mimic human actions while interacting with digital systems and automating business processes. 

In this project, we will develop an automation to sort files into the appropriate subfolders based on the file name.
